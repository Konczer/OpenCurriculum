\section{Introduction}

This document is a summary based on my experience as a Mentor at the \href{https://milestone-institute.org/}{Milestone Institute}, and as a former high school student at a Hungarian school in Slovakia, and University student at \href{https://www.bme.hu/?language=en}{BUTE} and \href{https://www.elte.hu/en/}{ELTE} in Budapest.

Hopefully, this document will be helpful not only for those, who have similar interests to me, but it can bring us one step further towards a society, where more experienced people share their knowledge with younger ones, and where quality education is a shared value and a social enterprise.

\section{Using the Internet}

The internet is an inevitable source of knowledge and information, so it is essential to know how to use it effectively.

First of all, I would highlight a short course: \href{https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtN07XYqqWSKpPrtNDiCHTzU}{How to navigate digital media} on Crash Course. It talks about the essential features of Online Media.


\href{https://www.wikipedia.org/}{Wikipedia} is a surprisingly good starting point to gain information. (A nice way to listen to the ongoing creation of Wikipedia can be found \href{http://listen.hatnote.com/#nowelcomes,en}{here}.)

Although, Wikipedia is a good starting point, and can give an overall picture, it is important to be able to follow the references, which are provided at the end of the articles.
These are usually books and/or scientific articles. \footnote{Other encyclopedia type sites, which I would mention are: \href{https://www.britannica.com/}{Encyclopædia Britannica}, \href{http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Main_Page}{Scholarpedia}, \href{https://www.encyclopedia.com/}{encyclpedia.com} and for philosophy \href{https://plato.stanford.edu/index.html}{Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}.}

It is usually possible to access these materials, however, one has to take ethical and practical considerations into account as well.
These materials are accessible mainly by violating copyrights and/or paywalls. This is not only legally questionable, but one has to think about the sustainability of quality knowledge and content making. Copyright can be \href{https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-3984-3_7}{debated} (see also \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFMl0stqai0}{here}, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_copyright}{here} and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_science_and_culture}{here} (\href{https://www.ted.com/talks/lawrence_lessig_laws_that_choke_creativity}{here})), but it is part of the Human Rights (\href{https://www.humanrights.com/what-are-human-rights/videos/copyright.html}{Article 27}), and is implemented in USA, EU and various national legal systems. Copyright and Intellectual Property rights play an important role in financing content creators, which means, that if one accesses quality contents without paying a contribution, then the financial support of the creator should be made in some another way.
\href{https://www.patreon.com/}{Patreon} is a possible way to support content creators, which can produce free and quality content, however the distribution of financial support for authors is still a challenging problem (see \href{https://ko-fi.com/}{buy a coffee} as a recent attempt), which still needs creative problem solvers in the future.

After these legal, ethical and financial comments, I would like to mention two sites to access scientific books and articles: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sci-Hub}{Sci-Hub} for articles under paywall and \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_Genesis}{Library Genesis} for books.

On the internet credibility of a source is key, which should be determined. In case of scientific articles the Journal where they appeared is an important indication of their credibility. In general, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer_review}{peer-reviewed} articles are considered more reliable than non peer-reviewed ones. Some most popular scientific journals are: \href{https://www.nature.com/}{Nature}, \href{https://www.sciencemag.org/}{Science}, \href{https://journals.plos.org/plosone/}{Plos One}, \href{https://journals.aps.org/}{Phys. Rew.} (There are some sites, where quality non peer-reviewed content can be found. The main example is \href{https://arxiv.org/}{arXiv}, other mentionable \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_preprint_repositories}{preprint servers} are \href{https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/}{HAL} and \href{https://www.biorxiv.org/}{bioRxiv}.)

Another obvious starting point to gain information from is \href{https://www.google.com/}{Google}, however, there are many \href{https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/}{operators} which can be used to search more effectively.
An alternative to Google is \href{https://duckduckgo.com/}{DuckDuckGo}, which lists different sites, and gives more privacy than Google.\footnote{Google's Russian and Chinese alternatives are \href{https://yandex.com/}{Yandex} and \href{https://www.baidu.com/}{Baidu} respectively.}

To have a feeling about the structure of the ``internet'', one can browse an outdated, but still more or less relevant \href{https://internet-map.net/}{map} of the internet. A list of the biggest websites (globally and by country) can be found on \href{https://www.alexa.com/topsites}{Alexa}. (Or a more recent poster can be seen \href{https://www.visualcapitalist.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/top-100-websites-ranking.html}{here})

To see how some sites evolved in time, one can use \href{https://archive.org/web/}{Wayback Machine} to explore (and/or make) archived versions of sites. 

On the internet, sites can be different not only in time, but by accessing them from different location. (A site (or a server) knows about you \href{https://whatismyipaddress.com/}{this} amount of information.) To access sites, with possible Geo-blocking one can use \href{https://www.howtogeek.com/133680/htg-explains-what-is-a-vpn/}{VPN}.

On the internet there are many-many things, and sometimes you are searching for alternative sites. In these cases \href{https://alternativeto.net/}{AlternativeTo} or \href{https://www.similarsites.com/}{SimilarSites} can be helpful.

Gain information about a website, use \href{http://whois.domaintools.com/}{who is} and possibly check it on \href{https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/}{Alexa} or on \href{https://www.similarweb.com/}{SimilarWeb}.

\subsection{Current information}

It is crucial to realize, that in general the aim of news organizations is to grab attention, and not to give a balanced world view to the readers.
It does not mean, that news organizations always want to distort our view, but it means, that if someone wants to have a realistic view, then reading the headlines is not enough. Additional sources and statistics are crucial for a better understanding of the world around us.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://ourworldindata.org/}{Our World in Data}
    \item \href{https://www.gapminder.org/}{Gapminder}
\end{itemize}

To understand the case, one can watch \href{https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_is_the_world_getting_better_or_worse_a_look_at_the_numbers}{Stephen Pinker}'s presentation, or these articles on \href{https://ourworldindata.org/wrong-about-the-world}{Our World in Data} and \href{https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20190111-seven-reasons-why-the-world-is-improving}{BBC Future} (based on the data from Gapminder).

On the other hand, positive change will not happen, if individuals don't take actions, and past statistics will not inform us about current trends, movements, challenges. For that we need reliable news sources (or a way to extract information from imperfect and biased sources).

To check a news source's \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_bias}{Media bias} one can use these sites
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.allsides.com/media-bias/media-bias-chart}{AllSides}
    \item \href{https://www.adfontesmedia.com/intro-to-the-media-bias-chart/}{The Media Bias Chart}
    \item \href{https://mediabiasfactcheck.com}{Media Bias/Fact Check}
\end{itemize}

To fact check some typically sensational news one can use these sites
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.snopes.com/}{Snopes} in English
    \item \href{https://www.urbanlegends.hu/}{Urban legends} in Hungarian
\end{itemize}

An incomplete list of reliable International and/or English news sites:
\begin{itemize}
\item General news with little bias
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://apnews.com/}{AP}
    \item \href{https://www.reuters.com/}{Reuters}
    \item \href{https://www.npr.org/}{NPR}
    \item \href{https://www.bbc.com/news}{BBC News}
    \item \href{https://www.dw.com/en/}{Deutsche Welle}
\end{itemize}
\item Thematic news
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.economist.com/}{The Economist} (Economics)
    \item \href{https://www.ft.com/}{Financial Times} (Economics, finance)
    \item \href{https://www.wired.com/}{Wired} (IT, Technology)
    \item \href{https://www.politico.com/}{Politico} (Politics)
    \item \href{https://www.euronews.com/}{EuroNews} (Europe, EU)

\end{itemize}
\item Left leaning, but still reliable sources
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.theguardian.com/}{The Guardian}
    \item \href{https://www.theatlantic.com/}{The Atlantic}
\end{itemize}
\item Right leaning (economically), but still reliable source \footnote{a more complete USA based list of right wing / conservative news sites is available \href{https://techpresident.com/best-conservative-news-sites/}{here}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://reason.com/}{Reason}
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An incomplete list of reliable and/or relevant Hungarian news sites:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://eduline.hu/}{Eduline} (Education, news about schools and Universities)
    \item \href{https://qubit.hu/}{Qubit} (Science and Technology)
    \item \href{https://telex.hu/}{Telex} (General news, slightly liberal, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://www.valaszonline.hu/}{Válasz} (General, slightly conservative, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://magyarhang.org/}{Magyar Hang} (General, independent, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://merce.hu/}{Mérce} (General, left leaning, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://magyarnemzet.hu/}{Magyar Nemzet} (General, pro government)
    \item \href{https://mandiner.hu/}{Mandiner} (General, pro government)
    \item \href{https://444.hu/}{444} (General, liberal, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://azonnali.hu/}{Azonnali} (General, more or less balanced, critical to government)
    \item \href{https://atlatszo.hu/}{Atlatszó} (Investigatory ``watch dog'' journalism, critical to government)
    \item \href{http://www.transindex.ro/}{Transindex} (General, Hungarian minority in Romania)
    \item \href{https://ujszo.com/}{Ujszo} (General, Hungarian minority in Slovakia)
    \item \href{https://www.magyarszo.rs/}{MagyarSzo} (General, Hungarian minority in Serbia)
\end{itemize}


There is a list of centralized, pro government media sources, called \href{https://cepmf.hu/}{KESMA}, which has a conservative/populist bias. Together with the state media \href{http://mtva.hu/}{MTV}, these news sources represent the governments narrative.

\href{https://index.hu/}{Index} was a slightly liberal portal, critical to government, however in 2020 after changes in top management, most of the journalists resigned, and started \href{https://telex.hu/}{Telex.hu}. After this turn Index become slightly pro government, but kept some elements of its original style.

For a more comprehensive list see the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_newspapers_in_Hungary}{collection of Hungarian newspapers} on Wikipedia.

In politically sensitive questions I highly suggest to read and watch multiple sources, mainly in and about Hungary.

A list of unreliable, ``news'' sites, which produce content purely to maximize their click numbers is published by \href{https://www.urbanlegends.hu/2020/01/megteveszto-magyar-hiroldalak-listaja-2020/}{Urban Legends}.

\subsection{Blogs}

Today everyone with internet connection can be a content creator. Blogging is neither professional journalism, nor scientific publishing, but sometimes professionals and enthusiasts can write about interesting ideas in a accessible way. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://medium.com/}{Medium}
\end{itemize}

Examples of informative technical blogs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://waitbutwhy.com/}{Wait But Why}
    \item \href{https://www.inference.vc/}{inFERENCe}
    \item \href{https://mathbabe.org/}{mathbabe}
    \item \href{https://jessegalef.com/}{Galef siblings}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forums}

Online forums can be good sources of information, if one can critically investigate the opinions and suggestions which can be read there. In general \href{https://stackexchange.com/sites#}{Stack Exchange} is considered as a useful international online forum.
\href{https://www.reddit.com/}{Reddit} is one of the biggest general forum, with many ``subreddits''. The quality of the content is fluctuating, but there are some intersting concepts, like the Ask Me Anything (\href{https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/}{AMA}) sections, where professionals, interesting and/or popular people answer to questions from the users.
A general forum in the internet is \href{https://www.quora.com/Where-is-the-list-of-all-the-topics-on-Quora}{Quora} this is very general, and further investigation is needed to check the information from it.

In Hungarian one of the oldest IT forums is \href{https://prohardver.hu/forum/index.html}{Prohardver}. A much newer general online forum is \href{https://www.gyakorikerdesek.hu/}{Gyakori kerdesek}, which unfortunately has a low reliability.
There is also a Hungarian subreddit on \href{https://www.reddit.com/r/hungary/}{Reddit}.

\subsection{Misc}

\end{itemize}

\section{Subjects}

\subsection{Physics}

Physics is one of the ``hardest'' branch in the Natural sciences, and is the purest embodiment of the \href{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/scientific-method/}{Scientific method}.
It briefly means, that it builds testable mathematical models about the world, mainly in a reductionist way. (Reductionism brought us to the current impressive level of understanding, and predictive power, however, it is less useful in attacking complex systems.)
It has 2-3 branches: Theoretical physics, which is mostly about model making, Experimental physics, which is about collecting data and designing experiments, and Computational physics which is sometimes viewed as a separate branch, and tries to compute the consequences of theoretical models (typically with many constituents).

\begin{itemize}

\item \href{https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/}{The Feynman Lectures on Physics} One of the best theoretical physics introduction. It uses a little bit of calculus, but because of its didactic style, interested  high school students can read it as well. Feynman on \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MO0r930Sn_8}{magnets}.

\subsection{Mathematics}

Mathematics has many-many sides, one would say it is a language, others would say it is a playful but rational way of thinking and problem solving, still others would emphasize its extraordinary usefulness in science and technology.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://moly.hu/konyvek/obadovics-j-gyula-matematika}{Obádovics} book is a detailed and didactic book which is a textbook, perfect for high school students. However, it does not contain too many proofs. Its main aim is to give a solid basis for the usage of high school mathematics mainly in engineering problems. (Which is only one side of mathematics.) It is in Hungarian, online available \href{https://www.scribd.com/document/351926211/Obadovics-J-Gyula-Matematika-pdf}{here}.

    \item \href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192221.How_to_Solve_It}{How to Solve It?} by George Pólya is about how to approach a problem systematically, but creatively. ``Teaching is an Art''. See a summary \href{https://math.berkeley.edu/~gmelvin/polya.pdf}{here} (or on \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_to_Solve_It}{wikipedia}), and a Pólya's performance \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0gbw-Ur_do}{here}.

\subsection{Computer Science}

Computer Science (CS) is a huge umbrella term, which covers Algorithms, Programming, Theoretical information theory, Networking, Cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics and vast number of other areas.
Broadly speaking it can be divided into Theoretical Computer Science, and Applied Computer Science, which is basically programming.

This branch is more industry and application driven then Physics and Mathematics in general, because of its huge and recent impact on society (see \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Revolution}{Digital revolution} and the  \href{https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/01/the-fourth-industrial-revolution-what-it-means-and-how-to-respond/}{fourth industrial revolution}).
However, many other academic and even ethical questions arise which are deeply connected to Computer Science and its applications.

Computer science is a rapidly advancing field and the cutting edge is moving very fast. Because of that computer science is not something what can be learned completely from an older, more experienced teacher, but is a constantly ongoing discourse, between accumulated knowledge and novel technologies.

Because of its reflexivity on society, \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethics_of_artificial_intelligence}{AI ethics} is a relevant part of CS.

The first working code is crucial, because from it one can explore the functionalities of a language (or a package) by little, incremental steps trough working codes. (Without a complete list of languages and editors, or Integrated Development Environments (IDE-s).)

\subsection{Chemistry}

\textbf{Disclaimer: I'm not a chemist, and didn't do any serious chemistry during my University studies. My view on chemistry is highly subjective, and probably naive. A contribution of a more experienced chemist would be valuable.}

I think chemistry as a field is worthless without experiments. If I needed to introduce chemistry to a high school student, I would say, that it is primarily magic and craft, and its view from a analytical and critical lens is secondary (however that makes chemistry a science).

\subsection{Biology}

\textbf{Disclaimer: I'm not a physician or a biologist, and I didn't do any biology class during my University studies. My view on biology is highly subjective, and probably extremely naive. A contribution of a more experienced biologist/physician would be valuable.}

Biology is of course a huge umbrella term. In my personal view Biology as a field investigates replicators, which can evolve and interact. More specifically Biology is about chemical life, in which DNA/RNA molecules evolve by mutations and complicated interactions. (It is interesting, that this life form is the dominant and most complex one that we know.)

Closely related fields are Physiology and Medicine, which are more anthropomorphic (in my view), and are interested in the functioning and ``health'' of a single individual.

\section{Subjects II}

To save further lines of disclaimers I grouped the subjects I know less about together.

A \textbf{General Disclaimer} holds:
\textbf{I'm not a Philosopher / Psychologist / Historian / Economist / Sociologist / Lawyer, etc., and I didn't do any serious formal classes during my University studies regarding these fields. My view on these subjects is highly subjective, and probably extremely naive. A contribution of more experienced scholars/practitioners is much needed.}

Against my limited knowledge in the topics, I tried to collect together useful links and sources I learned from interested students, and fill the gaps with resources I found reliable or useful for my self.
The patchwork of resources, competitions, books, all with varying depth and difficulty can not provide a coherent track for serious self study. However I hope it can help in initial explorations and can enrich a standard curriculum.

\subsection{Volunteering/Activism}

Reflecting critically on our social circumstance and being an active members of society is a virtue in our modern world.
However, one needs knowledge and wisdom to see the relevant problems, and determination to act effectively.
While learning your civic roles,
be critical, be active, and be brave to revise your own goals and actions time to time.




\subsubsection{Real world challenges}
Real world challenges does not need to be global. However there are some, which are widely recognised:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://reports.weforum.org/global-risks-report-2020/}{Global Risk Report} by the World Economic Forum
    \item \href{https://www.ipcc.ch/}{The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Organisations}
There are many organizations, where one can do volunteering. Some of these are international, some national, and some focusing on a small area.
But keep in mind, that you can be active even without joining an organization (for instance by picking up trash in nature).
\begin{itemize}

\section{University choice}

In the 21st century any theoretical material can be learned if someone has a working internet connection. There is a huge variety of online courses, many books and papers are accessible. However, Universities are still useful for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Providing practical classes and access to laboratories
    \item Socializing with your classmates, which can provide a valuable professional network
    \item Changing and shaping your world view
    \item Can give opportunities for research (mainly during MSc and PhD)
    \item Accommodates you to the academic workload
\end{itemize}

There are three main University ranking sites, which provide a lot of additional useful information.
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/2020/world-ranking}{Times Higher Education}
\item \href{https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2020}{QS}
\item \href{http://www.shanghairanking.com/}{Shanghai Ranking}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interview tips}

There are some universities, when an interview is part of the application process. Before preparing for this round, I think the most important thing is to realize what the interview process is for.

Here the interviewers are usually {\bf not} interested in how flawlessly the candidate can answer all the questions, but in the following 3 main aspects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Interest
    \item Grasp of discipline-appropriate way of thinking
    \item Teachability
\end{itemize}

These are mainly meta-learning skills, for which practicing previous interview questions does not help. To figure out the mentioned aspects, the interviewers will ask hard questions, to the point when the candidate needs to figure something out, provide reasons, and take hints / help from the interviewers. If one can calmly form a coherent (but not necessarily perfect) argument and incorporate hints, then not knowing an answer here is not a bug but a feature.

Be prepared to talk about your interests, your motivation to apply to the specific place, and be open for problem solving and reasoning.

For more information see:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \href{https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/applying-to-oxford/guide/interviews}{Oxford} interview
    \item \href{https://www.undergraduate.study.cam.ac.uk/applying/interviews}{Cambridge} interview
\end{itemize}

Past interview questions are available \href{https://ianramsey.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Sample-Oxbridge-Interview-Questions.pdf}{here} and \href{https://www.thatoxfordgirl.com/post/50-real-life-oxford-university-interview-questions}{here}. (There are some other sources, including a  \href{https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Oxbridge-Interview-Guide-UniAdmissions/dp/0993231136}{book}, but I think it is not essential for preparation.)

For online interviews one can get familiar with online shareable drawing tools like \href{https://miro.com/app/dashboard/}{Miro}.

\section{Elements of Pastoral care}

In this section I want to share my highly subjective thoughts about psychological difficulties, existential crisis, burn out, well being, finding identity and finding meaning in life.
Naturally, I will not provide solid answers to these questions, but I want to summarize the sources and directions which I found useful for myself, for my close friends and relatives, and my former mentees.

In this section, I will use quotes and poetry, not because they are good in transmitting information precisely, but because they can serve as mirrors, and one can explore and understand themselves by them. Because this section is mostly about the reader, yes, about you.

\subsection{If you need help}

There are situations, which are clearly harmful, and intervention is needed. If you face abuse, or you are in danger otherwise, don't hasitate to reach out for consultation and help:

\subsection{Changing your self and/or changing the World}

\vspace{1cm}
{``God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\\
courage to change the things I can,\\
and wisdom to know the difference.''
\\[5pt]
\rightline{{\rm --- \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_Prayer}{Serenity Prayer}}}
}

I assume, that the reader of these lines is a teenager or a young adult. (And also I assume, that the reader is not in a miserable situation, where only by apathy or strong faith can they survive the days. I assume that they are not in luxury either from where injustice is merely visible.)

More often than not, people in their young ages observe injustice, unfairness, hypocrisy, etc. in the World, and they are annoyed by it and some of their suffering comes from the difference between how the World ``should be'' and how it is. This is perfectly normal, and absolutely necessary in a \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernity}{modern society}, where change is in many cases seen as constructive and not as a destructive force. 

To suggest some material about change and the possible ways to it I suggest Barack Obama's relatively sober \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ioz96L5xASk}{advice} on the matter.


\subsection{Well being}

Well being is a highly subjective, and not easy to \href{https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/}{define} concept.
However, to give some simple and hopefully useful advice, I would list a few relevant concepts popularized by \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amit_Sood}{Amit Sood}:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gratitude
    \item Compassion
    \item Acceptance
    \item Meaning
    \item Forgiveness
\end{itemize}

A more detailed list, containing elements, which in my view can be relevant when one faces difficulties, or wants to be more resilient or balanced:

(This is not a check list, and there is no objective grading between the concepts. It can happen, that for you some elements are crucial, while others are irrelevant. These are only aspects, which often can come up as relevant factors.)

\begin{itemize}
    \item Meaning
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Meaning is both a deep concept, and a meaningless cliché.

        \item \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai}{Ikigai}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Food
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Food and diet can lead to heated debate even between experts. Because of that my suggestion is not to search for the ``best'' diet, but to be a bit more conscious, make incremental changes, and figure out which diet would fit best into our own life.
        \item The link between mental health and diet is summarized \href{https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/a-to-z/d/diet-and-mental-health}{here} and on this \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/articles/diet_wellbeing}{BBC article}
        \item a very basic introduction on BBC \href{https://www.bbc.co.uk/bitesize/topics/zf339j6/articles/zmwvgdm}{Bitsize}
        \item food has a big impact on \href{https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/healthy-eating-for-beginners}{health and quality of life}

        \item and a few \href{https://mindfulnessexercises.com/sleep-meditation-scripts/}{mindfulness tips}
    \end{itemize}
    \item Compassion
    \begin{itemize}
        \item ``feeling for another''
        \item a somewhat relevant \href{https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/6697537-everyone-you-meet-is-fighting-a-battle-you-know-nothing}{quote}, which has many \href{https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/06/29/be-kind/#more-778}{variants} : ``Everyone you meet is fighting a battle you know nothing about. Be kind. Always.''
        \item compassion and empathy is not only a deeply rooted instinct and possibly foundation of many aspects of morality and ethics, but by cultivating it, one can expand even its identity beyond the spacial and temporal boundaries we usually think our self is confined in.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Social network
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Long lasting, meaningful social relationships, with friends and family was found as the most important factor in \href{https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2017/04/over-nearly-80-years-harvard-study-has-been-showing-how-to-live-a-healthy-and-happy-life/}{Harvard Study of Adult Development}.
    Keep in mind, that this is a precious resource, and put energy to develop and maintain your connections, prioritizing quality over quantity.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Romantic relationship
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Romantic relationships, seduction, long term relationships, marriage and sexuality is widely debated topic on different levels, and from different aspects. This note can not aim to give a complete discussion of the topic, it tries only to give some starting points and maybe two suggestions:
        Romantic relationships are changing, because the world around us is changing, this is why creativity and flexibility starts to be more and more important in long term relationships, and why old customs don't always work.
        There is no one single method for seduction, and real romantic relationships can not be measured in success rates. That is why I would warn you against the so called \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pickup_artist}{Pickup artist} movement, which targets mainly young heterosexual males, and beside teaching some basic psychology and manipulative techniques totally misses the point by basically objectifying women.

Meaning is not something we only find, it is something we create. It is maybe not objectively out there, but most people need to feel that they and/or their life has a meaning.

\vspace{1cm}

\subsection{Practices}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Meditation. (But be careful! \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P8PCsy268As}{Matthieu Ricard})
    \begin{itemize}
    \item doing a meditation is profoundly easy, and in its basic form it is nothing else then getting familiar with your inner workings by patient and accepting observation. For example you sit down for 10-15 minutes, and just observe your mind and body without any specific aim.
    \item single sessions of meditation will probably not make any difference, but a daily cultivation can gradually have an effect on your mind and even on your body and brain. Similarly how teeth brushing works.
    \item for more detailed basic instructions see this \href{https://www.mindful.org/how-to-meditate/}{guide}
    \item a \href{https://www.sciencefocus.com/news/can-mindfulness-and-meditation-be-harmful/}{word of caution}: meditation (or getting more conscientious about your body and mind) is not a feelgood exercise only, and if you have unresolved conflicts, they can come up, and if you have rigid believes about reality and your self they can be altered. Go gradually, and ask for help, if you feel too uneasy in a situation.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Cold exposure
    \begin{itemize}
        \item also known as the \href{https://www.wimhofmethod.com/}{Wim Hof method}. See a \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6EPuUdIC1E}{summary} about the matter

\subsection{Rules, Paths, Advice}

There is no ultimate rule book for life. Every list will only grasp a little fraction of the complexity of existence. To show different flavours and the inconsistent nature of rules I listed some popular / interesting ones together.



\subsubsection{The Noble Eightfold Path}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Right understanding (Samma ditthi)
    \item Right thought (Samma sankappa)
    \item Right speech (Samma vaca) 
    \item Right action (Samma kammanta)
    \item Right livelihood (Samma ajiva) 
    \item Right effort (Samma vayama)
    \item Right mindfulness (Samma sati)
    \item Right concentration (Samma samadhi)
\end{enumerate}
The Buddhist tradition is 2500 years old, and counting. Because of that I believe it needs some context. I suggest \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhlj_SU9SAE}{Secular Buddhism} lecture by Stephen Batchelor.
(Right understanding traditionally refers to accepting reinkarnation. However, the process seems to work ``only'' by accepting the rule of cause and effect, and the non absolute status of our own ego.)

To have a little broader historical view on Buddha and Buddhism I suggest this \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulSlL3ubJ3c}{documentary}.

\subsubsection{Discipline}

\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stand up straight with your shoulders back
    \item Treat yourself like you are someone you are responsible for helping
    \item Make friends with people who want the best for you
    \item Compare yourself with who you were yesterday, not with who someone else is today
    \item Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
    \item Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
    \item Pursue what is meaningful (not what is expedient)
    \item Tell the truth — or, at least, don’t lie
    \item Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don’t
    \item Be precise in your speech
    \item Do not bother children when they are skate-boarding

\end{minipage}
\hfill
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.45\textwidth}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make your bed
    \item Find people to paddle with you
    \item Measure the size of heart, not flippers
    \item Get over being a sugar cookie and keep moving forward
    \item Don't be afraid of the circuses
    \item Sometimes you have to slide down obstacles head first
    \item Don't back down from the sharks
    \item You must be your very best in the darkest moments
    \item Start singing when you're up to your neck in mud.  Hope for everyone
    \item Don't ever, ever ring the bell
\end{enumerate}

Jordan Peterson is a polarising character, however he and his message become very popular in a short amount of time, possibly reflecting a hunger for similar father figures. Personally I think discipline and strength are not the single most important skills we need in life, but I mention this school, because some people in some stages of their life might need some push in these areas, and probably they can resonate to this kind of messages.\footnote{However I would mention, that a similar kind of Christianity inspired self-hep book is not entirely new. Here I would mention \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M._Scott_Peck}{M. Scott Peck} and his book \href{https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347852.The_Road_Less_Traveled}{The Road Less Traveled}.} 
My meta advice is to be able to maintain discipline, but don't stop there!

\subsubsection{More Rules}

(I want to add, that if one has a dream, and a will to work on it, then it should not be forgotten, even if it is being and actor.)

\end{minipage}

\subsubsection{One ``self help'' book}

I put this here, because based on the \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz8sUiXAnbs}{the authors summary} The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck seems to be actual (in the current (2016) Western world for a middle-upper class reader), and it can embed some core concepts from long existing philosophical traditions into this context.
I don't recommend this for depth, but some concepts can be viewed as a fair first approximation for the complex art of living in our times.

\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Planning and writing about yourself}

\end{itemize}



\subsubsection{Motivation}

So I think motivational speeches and motivational speakers represent the fast food version of the mentioned concepts. My advise – being coherent with the opening quote – is to be suspicious with speakers, who claim that you can achieve (usually material) success without major failures, crises and hard work.
You will need to learn, and you will learn the most by failures. If you never fail, then you were not ambitious enough.
As you will learn and grow (or simply by being in a new environment) your value system will at least partially change. This will most probably induce an existential crisis. This can be painful, but it can cause a leap in your growth.
If somebody says, that you should not experience sadness, and gloominess, and you should change yourself to achieve material success, \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NA4uTFeHEFA}{run}.
