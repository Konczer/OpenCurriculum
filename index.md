# Open and Subjective Curriculum

This document is a summary based on my experience as a Mentor at the [Milestone Institute](https://milestone-institute.org/), and as a former high school student at a Hungarian school in Slovakia, and University student at [BUTE](https://www.bme.hu/?language=en) and [ELTE](https://www.elte.hu/en/) in Budapest.

Hopefully, this document will be helpful not only for those, who have similar interests to me, but it can bring us one step further towards a society, where more experienced people share their knowledge with younger ones, and where quality education is a shared value and a social enterprise.
